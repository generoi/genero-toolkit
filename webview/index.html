# Genero Toolkit - Plugin Description

The **Genero Toolkit** extension is designed to facilitate running commands from a `genero.json` file within Visual Studio Code. It provides a tree view in the Explorer sidebar where you can see a list of commands defined in the `genero.json` file and execute them easily.

## How to Use

### 1. Install the Extension

First, make sure you have Visual Studio Code installed. Then, follow these steps:

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Go to the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X).
3. Search for "Genero Toolkit" and click Install.

### 2. Define Commands in genero.json

In order to use the extension, you need to define commands in the `genero.json` file. Here's how:

1. Create a `genero.json` file in the `.vscode` directory of your project (if it doesn't already exist).
2. Add commands to the `genero.json` file following the specified format. Each command should have a unique name, a title, and the command to be executed.
3. Save the `genero.json` file.

### 3. Execute Commands

Once you have defined commands in the `genero.json` file, you can execute them using the extension. Here's how:

1. Open your project in Visual Studio Code.
2. Open the "Genero Commands" view from the Explorer sidebar.
3. Expand the tree view to see the list of commands.
4. Click on a command to execute it.

## Example genero.json File

      "description": "Lists files in the project"
    },
    "build": {
      "title": "Build Project",
      "cmd": "npm run build",
      "description": "Builds the project using npm"
    }
